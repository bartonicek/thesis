# Introduction {#introduction}

Humans are intensely visual creatures. About 20-30% of our brain is involved in visual processing [@van2003; @sheth2016], utilizing a highly sophisticated and powerful visual processing pipeline [see e.g. @goebel2004; @knudsen2020; for a brief review, see @ware2019]. It is well-established the brain can process certain salient visual stimuli in sub-20-millisecond times, outside of conscious attention [@ledoux2000; @ledoux2003], and that people can make accurate, parallel, and extremely rapid visual judgements, in phenomena known as subitizing and pre-attentive processing [@mandler1982; @treisman1985]. These features make the visual cortex the most powerful channel that humans have for receiving information, both in terms of bandwidth and throughput.

Statisticians have known about the power of visual presentation for a long time. 

The thesis is organized as follows. First, in Section \@ref(litreview), I reviews the history of interactive data visualization and discusses general trends and issues in the field. Second, in Section \@ref(problems), I discuss specific problems that one faces when designing an interactive data visualization pipeline. Third, in Section \@ref(goals), I outline the specific goals and aims I had while developing the interactive data visualization library. Fourth, Section \@ref(system) details the specific components and design considerations of the system. Sixth, in Section \@ref(example), I show an applied example of exploring a real-world data set, using my interactive data visualization library. Finally, in Section [TODO:DISCUSSION], I discuss lessons learned and potential future directions.
