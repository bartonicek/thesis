#### API {#API}

The term "API" (application programming interface) is used in many different ways in many different contexts. However, in general, it tends to describe a bounded surface area that a program or service provides for interaction with other programs or services [see e.g. @bloch2006; @ofoeda2019]. For instance, the set of objects that a package or library exports, and the way these exported objects are structured and organized, can be considered an API.  However, the term API can also describe a protocol or a data format. The term is also sometimes used interchangeably with "Web API," which refers to a set of rules for communicating with specific web servers, typically using the HTTP protocol.

#### JSON {#JSON}

Short for "JavaScript Object Notation", JSON is a flexible data format based on the JavaScript object type [also known as the "plain old JavaScript object", POJO, see @ecma2024; see also e.g. @bourhis2017; @pezoa2016]. On the top level, a JSON is a key-value store with string keys and values of any of the following types: string, number, boolean, null (an undefined/missing value), an array (which can contain any other valid JSON values), or another JSON object. 

For example, the following is a valid JSON:

```{ts}
#| eval: false
{
  "name": "Adam",
  "age": 30,
  "friends": [{ "name": "Sam", "age": 30 }, { "name": "Franta", "age": 26 }],
  "can drive": true,
  "problems": null
}
```

The JSON specification is more restrictive compared to the full JavaScript object type (as implemented in the browser and various JavaScript runtimes). JavaScript runtime objects are very flexible - they can contain non-string keys (numbers or symbols) and non-primitive values such as functions/methods. In contrast, JSON is a fairly "simple" format designed for declaring and transporting data. For this reason, JSON is often used as the medium for sending data to and from Web APIs [@bourhis2017; @pezoa2016] as well as for configuration documents.

The main advantages of JSON are that it is a simple, flexible, and human-readable format. Also, due to its recursive nature (JSON arrays and objects can contain other JSON arrays and objects), it can be used to express a wide variety of hierarchical data structures which would not be efficient to express in "flat" data formats such as CSV. However, this flexibility also comes with some disadvantages. The recursive nature of the format makes parsing JSON files inherently more time- and compute-intensive, and, since the values in a JSON can be of any type (as long as it is a valid JSON type), it is often necessary to validate JSON inputs [@pezoa2016].      

#### GoG

An acronym of the popular Grammar of Graphics model described by @wilkinson2012. Essentially, this model treats data visualizations as composed of semi-independent, modular components, which include variables, statistics, scales, coordinate systems, aesthetics, and geometries. This model has seen implementations in numerous data visualization systems, such as `ggplot2` [@wickham2016], Vega and Vegalite [@satyanarayan2016], or Tableau [@tableau2023]. 

#### IDE

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that streamlines software development by providing utilities and automation tools for various stages of the workflow, such as writing code, testing, debugging, building, and version control. A core component is a text editor, which may be enhanced by various features such as syntax highlighting and code completion. IDEs may also include integrated debuggers, version control systems, and other tools. Some IDEs primarily focus on a single programming language [such as @rstudio2024], whereas others offer full multi-language support [e.g. Visual Studio Code, @microsoft2025].    

#### SVG

Short for "Scalable Vector Graphics", SVG is a flexible markup language for defining vector graphics [@mdn2024b]. Based on XML, SVG graphics are specified as a hierarchy of elements enclosed by tags. These tags may be given attributes, further modifying their behavior.

For example, the following is a valid SVG:

```
<svg width="400" height="400">
  <circle cx="200" cy="200" r="50" fill="skyblue"></circle>
  <rect x="150" y="150" width="50" height="50" fill="firebrick"></rect>
</svg>
```

And this is its output, as interpreted by a Web browser:

<svg width="300" height="300">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="300" fill="antiquewhite"></rect>
  <circle cx="150" cy="150" r="100" fill="skyblue"></circle>
  <rect x="50" y="50" width="100" height="100" fill="firebrick"></rect>
</svg>

Compared to typical raster formats such as PNG or JPEG, in which the image is defined as an array of bytes (pixels), SVG's primary advantage is its lossless quality: images can be arbitrarily scaled or transformed without affecting the image's quality. SVG images can also be easily manipulated and animated by modifying the elements' attributes (for example, to move the red rectangle in the image above to the right, we could simply increment its "x" attribute). However, the main disadvantage of SVG is that the file size scales with the number of objects in the image. As such, SVG images with many small objects (such as points on a scatterplot) can become prohibitively large and slow to render.
