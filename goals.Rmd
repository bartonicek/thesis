# Goals {#goals}

Beyond developing the theory described in Section \@ref(problems), another key objective of this doctoral project was to develop a compatible interactive data visualization system. This was realized through the creation and publication of the R package `plotscaper` (available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotscaper/index.html)) and the underlying JavaScript package `plotscape` (available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abartonicek/plotscape)). This section outlines some general considerations that informed the more specific design choices which will be discussed later on (Section \@ref(system)).

## User profile

A key first step in designing any kind of system is understanding the target audience. This is especially the case in interactive data visualization systems, which cater to a diverse range of users. As was discussed in Section \@ref(background), users of interactive data visualization systems can differ in their goals, experience, and motivation. These user requirements inform the design of interactive visualization systems. At one end of the spectrum, some interactive data visualization systems are designed with fairly minimal expectations of the user's level of experience or motivation. Conversely, other systems assume a highly motivated "expert" users with a sufficient level of domain expertise [@dimara2019] or the ability to contend with low-level execution details such as rendering or reactive event graph [@satyanarayan2015; @satyanarayan2016]. 

My goal was to design a package which would be accessible to a wide range of R users. Specifically, I wanted to empower novice users to quickly and easily create interactive figures for data exploration. Simultaneously, I wanted to provide more advanced users with the flexibility to leverage the full range of features and engage in deeper customization. Balancing these user requirements required some careful consideration. Overall, I generally opted for a simple design, abstracting away many low-level implementation details. Further, I prioritized several key features: a simple API with sensible defaults, a clean and intuitive user interface, and a robust set of built-in interactive capabilities.

## Programming interface

A key concern was designing a simple and intuitive application programming interface ([API]). Specifically, I wanted to make it easy for the average user to learn the package quickly and produce fairly complete and useful interactive figures with only a few lines of R code. The goal was to empower even users with limited programming experience to take advantage of interactive graphics.

Achieving this level of accessibility required several design choices. First, the API had to be relatively familiar. I tried to accomplish this by drawing inspiration from established packages. Specifically, the main inspirations for the `plotscaper` API were the popular `ggplot2` package [@wickham2016], as well as the `iplots` package [@urbanek2003; @urbanek2011]. However, `plotscaper`'s design goals also necessitated some deviations from these packages' APIs, see Section \@ref(system). Second, to further streamline the user experience, many of the components such as scales were given sensible defaults. Conversely, this also meant that extensive graphical customizability was not a primary concern: the goal was to empower the users to start exploring their data quickly, rather than spend time making fine-grained adjustments to the design of their figures. Third, to broaden its appeal, the package had to integrate seamlessly with existing tools within the R ecosystem. These included the popular RStudio [IDE] [@rstudio2024] and the RMarkdown document-authoring system [@xie2018].    

## User interface

While ease of writing user code was a key consideration, equally important was the ease of interpreting and interacting with the resulting visualizations. The visual design of the figures needed to facilitate acquisition of statistical insights, and the figures' behavior had to be clear and intuitive. As was discussed in Section \@ref(background), effective visual design is crucial, as poor design can make figures less legible or even misleading [see e.g. @tufte2001; @cairo2014; @cairo2019; @franconeri2021]. Similarly, the design of interactions can either enhance or hinder the acquisition of insights.

```{r plotscaper-design}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A simple example of a default `plotscaper` figure. Note the minimalist design: I opted for no axis ticks or grid lines, and generally muted auxiliary graphical elements to emphasize the data."
include_figure("figures/plotscaper_example1.html")
```

A general rule I applied to the design of the user interface `plotscaper` was "less is more". Specifically, following Tufte's [-@tufte2001] example, I aimed to design figures that would prioritize showing the data above all else, see Figure \@ref(fig:plotscaper-design). Visually, this was achieved by minimizing auxiliary graphical elements such as axis ticks, labels, and grid lines. I also tried to strive for a minimalist "pen and paper" look and feel, as if the figures were drawn in a notebook. For color, I decided to use muted colors for non-data elements and an established color palette for representing the data. Finally, when it came to interactive features, I tried to approach those with similar degree of minimalism. I tried to avoid distracting interactive features, such as having query tool-tips always appear on hover by default, and in general tried to design the user interactions in a way that would complement but not overwhelm the visual experience.

## Interactive features

The next important question was which interactive features to support. As was discussed in Section \@ref(background), there are many interactive data visualization features, with varying degrees of usefulness and implementation complexity. Therefore, choosing the right set of features to prioritize was a key design consideration.

As was hinted at throughout Section \@ref(background), and particularly in Section \@ref(linked-selection), the core feature to implement was generalized linked selection or brushing. Linked selection allows the users to quickly explore trends across different dynamically-generated subsets of the data, making it one of the most useful tools in interactive data visualization [@buja1996; @heer2012; @wilhelm2003; @wilhelm2008; @wills2008; @ware2019; @ward2015]. However, implementing generalized linked selection is not trivial. First, all plots need to be able respond to user interaction - such as clicking-and-dragging - by detecting which objects are inside the selection region, finding the corresponding cases, and forwarding this information as a selection event. Second, the system needs to keep track of which cases are currently selected and respond to selection events from the plots by updating and dispatching its own events. Finally, the plots must also react to the events from the system by recomputing all of the necessary summary statistics and re-rendering. Implementing this in an efficient and general manner is not trivial.

Further, as also discussed in Sections \@ref(linked-selection) and \@ref(stacking-part-whole), linked selection also presents some challenges for *displaying* the corresponding information. Naive solutions, like re-rendering the entire plot upon selection, produce unsatisfactory visual behavior, see for example the following quote by Wilhelm:

> "[Re-rendering the entire plot] only works ﬁne when we have individual plot symbols for each observation, as in scatterplots for example, where some attributes are changed by the user interaction. But even when replacing plot parameters the user loses the possibility to compare the current plot with previous versions. The user can only compare the current image with a mental copy of the previous image and hence the comparison might get distorted."
>
> Adalbert @wilhelm2008, Chapter II.9 of the Data Visualization Handbook, pp. 210

Combined, these issues make linked selection difficult to simply *add* on top of an existing static data visualization system. Instead, the feature has to be directly integrated into the data visualization pipeline, or rather, the data visualization pipeline has to be built *around it*. Therefore, during `plotscaper`'s development, developing the architecture for linked selection took up a significant amount of programming time and effort. 

Two other more advanced features I wanted to support were parameter manipulation and representation switching. These features give the user the ability to quickly see alternative views of their data and discover trends that they may otherwise miss, making them highly desirable (see Sections \@ref(representation-switching)). Further, like linked selection, these features affect more than just the surface-level graphical attributes of plots, requiring a direct integration into the data visualization pipeline. 

Querying was another feature which I deemed desirable. Querying can be highly useful in interactive workflows: upon seeing an interesting visual trend in their data, a user may want to inspect the precise data values underlying the graphic. While this feature is arguably simpler to implement than the previously discussed features, there are still some important nuances. For instance, users are typically *not* interested in the values of the visual attributes of the queried geometric objects, but instead in the original underlying summary statistics, which can at times differ. For instance, when querying a stacked barplot, we do not care about the stacked (accumulated) values, but instead about the values corresponding to individual segments. Further, users may also find it useful to query statistics which are not directly represented in the graphic at all (but are still computed on the corresponding data subset). As such, querying is not a purely graphical operation either, and does require some careful thought.

Another key development goal was inter-process communication between the figure (client) and an R session (server). Specifically, the ability to call functions in an interactive R session to manipulate or query the figure directly can be invaluable for data exploration. Unlike static visualization, this requires additional infrastructure: a running server and a client connection. Furthermore, for the figure to be able to both react to messages from the server and also send some messages of its own back, a bi-directional connection is necessary [i.e. sockets rather than unidirectional architecture such as REST, see @fielding2002].

There were also several useful features which were relatively straightforward to implement: changing size and alpha, zooming, and panning. What made these features easier to implement is that they directly manipulate more surface-level attributes of the plot (i.e. scales), without altering earlier stages of the visualization pipeline. Despite their simplicity, these features can still be highly useful in interactive workflows. For example, zooming and panning can help to reveal trends within narrow ranges of the data, while adjustments to size and alpha can mitigate overplotting. Therefore, implementing these features was an easy choice.

Finally, there were also several interactive features discussed in Section \@ref(common-features) which I choose not to implement, including selection operators, semantic zooming, and grand tours (and animation in general). The primary reason for this was that these features are quite advanced and specialized, making them better suited to dedicated packages rather than general interactive data visualization frameworks. There were also some more feature-specific reasons. For instance, while selection operators (ability to combine selections with logical operators such as AND, OR, or XOR, and chain sequences of these operations) can be a powerful tool for more advanced users, its utility for novices is debatable. Specifically, in line with @wills2000, who argued that selection systems should be simple, powerful, and forgiving, I opted for a simple transient/persistent selection model. Similarly, semantic zooming, while also powerful in specific contexts, did not seem worth the effort since it is limited to only a certain number of plot types such as maps. Finally, grand tours and animation also seemed to be beyond the scope of the package.

## Summary

The practical part of this project had two primary objectives: to create a versatile package for interactive data exploration and to explore the challenges discussed in Section \@ref(problems). The aim was to provide a tool which would be accessible to wide range of users, while also allowing some more advanced customization options. Achieving this required a simple API and an intuitive graphical interface. To support complex interactive workflows, I chose to implement a comprehensive suite of interactive features, including generalized linked selection, parameter manipulation, representation switching, querying, client-server communication, zooming, panning, and size/alpha adjustments.

In the next section, I will discuss concrete details regarding the implementation of the package, regarding both its high-level API (`plotscaper`) as well as the more low-level platform (`plotscape`).
