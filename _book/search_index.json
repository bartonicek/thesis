[["applied-example.html", "7 Applied example", " 7 Applied example Please note that the data set used in this section is fairly large (~70,000 rows) and so the figures below take some time to load. This section demonstrates a typical interactive workflow with plotscaper. The goal is to showcase the package’s key features and capabilities by exploring a large, real-world data set, pertaining to a pressing issue: mental health. Mental health is a global concern. In developed nations, mental health disorders are primary contributor to years lived with disability, significantly impacting both the well-being of individuals and the economic productivity of entire countries (Organization 2022). This issue, however, extends beyond developed nations. The global burden of mental health disorders has been steadily rising over the recent decades, a trend which is particularly concerning in low-income countries where access to mental health services is even more limited (Patel et al. 2018). Having had personal experience with friends and relatives impacted by mental health issues, as well as having majored in psychology during my undergraduate studies, I have had a long-standing interest in the topic. It is clear to me that mental health is a key challenge that the world is facing today, and the first step towards solving it will require clearly identifying key trends and patterns. For this reason, I chose to dedicate this section to an exploration of a large longitudinal mental health data set. 7.0.1 About the data set The Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic (IHIS, ÚZIS in Czech) is a government agency established by the Czech Ministry of Health. Its primary responsibility is the collection, processing, and reporting of medical data within the country of Czechia (ÚZIS 2024). Of interest, the institute provides high-quality, open-access medical data, including information about the use and manufacture of pharmaceutics, fiscal and employment records from healthcare facilities, and various epidemiological data sets. The Long-term care data set (Soukupová et al. 2023) contains longitudinal information about long-term psychiatric care in Czechia. More specifically, it contains aggregated data on individuals released from psychiatric care facilities between 2010 and 2022. It includes information such the region of the treatment facility, the sex of the patients, age category, diagnosis based on the international ICD-10 classification (World Health Organization 2024a, 2024b), the number of hospitalizations, and the total number of days spent in care by the given subset of patients. Here’s the data set at a quick glance: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/longterm_care.csv&quot;) dplyr::glimpse(df) ## Rows: 68,115 ## Columns: 12 ## $ year &lt;int&gt; 2019, 2016, 2011, 2013, 2019, 2013, 2018, 2017, 2019, 2015, 2018,… ## $ region_code &lt;chr&gt; &quot;CZ071&quot;, &quot;CZ064&quot;, &quot;CZ080&quot;, &quot;CZ072&quot;, &quot;CZ080&quot;, &quot;CZ053&quot;, &quot;CZ080&quot;, &quot;C… ## $ region &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Olomoucký kraj&quot;, &quot;Jihomoravský kraj&quot;, &quot;Moravskoslezský kraj&quot;, &quot;Z… ## $ sex &lt;chr&gt; &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;ma… ## $ diagnosis &lt;chr&gt; &quot;f10&quot;, &quot;f2&quot;, &quot;f7&quot;, &quot;f4 without f42&quot;, &quot;f60–f61&quot;, &quot;f32–f33&quot;, &quot;f3 wi… ## $ reason_for_termination &lt;chr&gt; &quot;release&quot;, &quot;early termination&quot;, &quot;early termination&quot;, &quot;early termi… ## $ age_category &lt;chr&gt; &quot;40–49&quot;, &quot;30–39&quot;, &quot;30–39&quot;, &quot;40–49&quot;, &quot;50–59&quot;, &quot;40–49&quot;, &quot;60–69&quot;, &quot;0… ## $ stay_category &lt;chr&gt; &quot;short&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, … ## $ field &lt;chr&gt; &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;psychiat… ## $ care_category &lt;chr&gt; &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;c… ## $ cases &lt;int&gt; 13, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 32, 2, 2, 1, 12, 1, 1, 2, 9, 18, 1, 1, 1, 1… ## $ days &lt;int&gt; 196, 345, 38, 108, 1, 47, 319, 3813, 120, 256, 151, 574, 49, 210,… The data contains over 68,000 rows, totaling over 410,000 individual-patient hospitalizations. Each row records the number patients with a particular set of of characteristics released from a treatment facility during a given year, and the number of days the patients spent in treatment in total. In the original version of the data set, the column names as well as the labels of the categorical variables are in Czech. To make the analysis more easily accessible to non-Czech speakers, I took the liberty of translating most of these to English (excluding the region variable). The translation script is available in the thesis repository. Additionally, the data set website contains a JSON schema with a text description of each of the variables (Soukupová et al. 2023). I translated these descriptions as well and provide them below, in Table 7.1: Table 7.1: Schema of the long-term care data set, including the original column names (Czech), as well as translated names and descriptions. Translated name Original name Description year rok The year hospitalization was terminated region_code kraj_kod Region code based on the NUTS 3 classification region kraj_nazev Region where the facility was located sex pohlavi Classification of patients’ sex diagnosis zakladni_diagnoza The primary diagnosis of the psychiatric disorder based on the ICD-10 classification reason_for_termination ukonceni The reason for termination of care age_category vekova_kategorie Classification of patients’ age category stay_category kategorie_delky_hospitalizace Classification of hospitalization based on length: short-term (&lt; 3 months), medium-term (3-6 months), and long-term (6+ months) field obor The field of psychiatric care care_category kategorie_pece Classification of care: child or adult cases pocet_hospitalizaci The total number of cases/hospitalizations in the given subgroup of patients days delka_hospitlizace The total time spent in care, in days (= sum of the number of days all patients in a given subgroup spent in care) Before we go on to explore the data set with interactive figures, there are a couple of things to note about the data set. The first is that the data has been pre-aggregated, such that each row represents the combined number of releases within a given subgroup of patients. For example, the first row indicates that, in the year 2019, 13 women aged 40-49 were released from treatment facilities in Olomoucký kraj (region), after receiving short-term care for F10 ICD-10 diagnosis (mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use, World Health Organization 2024a) for a sum total of 196 days: df[1, ] ## year region_code region sex diagnosis reason_for_termination age_category ## 1 2019 CZ071 Olomoucký kraj female f10 release 40–49 ## stay_category field care_category cases days ## 1 short psychiatry adult 13 196 The reason for this aggregation is likely to anonymize the data and reduce the risk of identifying individual patients (see e.g. Pina et al. 2024). However, when creating visualizations, we need to take the fact that each row represents a group of patients into account. For instance, when drawing a barplot, simply plotting row counts would not be appropriate, since that would ignore the size of the patient groups. Instead, to represent the data properly, we should aggregate (sum) either cases or days, depending on the question of interest. The same applies to all other aggregation plots, such as histograms (i.e. weighted histograms, see e.g. Unwin, Theus, and Härdle 2008) and fluctuation diagrams. Fortunately, as we will see, plotscaper makes it easy to create these weighted types visualizations. And further, while the information this aggregated data provides inherently less granular information than patient-level records, we will see that it still preserves a large amount of structure. 7.0.2 Interactive exploration 7.0.2.1 The relationship between cases and days We start by exploring the relationship between the two primary continuous variables of interest: cases (the number of patients in a given subgroup released from care) and days (the total number of days the given subgroup of patients spent in care). Intuitively, we would expect a positive, linear relationship between these variables, such that a larger patient groups should spend more days in care. We can use plotscaper to visualize this relationship via a scatterplot: library(plotscaper) # Load in the package df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; # Create a declarative schema for the figure add_scatterplot(c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; # Add a scatterplot render() # Render the schema into an interactive figure Interestingly, the pattern that the points show is not a simple linear trend. Instead, the points seem to cluster in three distinct “leaflets”, each exhibiting a roughly linear trend. This suggests the presence of a pooling effect, such that the overall trend is the result of combining three distinct groups. Closer inspection of the data reveals that the stay_category variable has three levels: short-term (&lt; 3 months), medium-term (3-6 months), and long-term (6+ months) care. Color-coding the cases indeed confirms that the three levels of stay_category correspond to the leaflets: df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; add_scatterplot(c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;stay_category&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; # y-axis is weighted by cases assign_cases(which(df$stay_category == &quot;short-term&quot;), 1) |&gt; # Mark short-term green assign_cases(which(df$stay_category == &quot;long-term&quot;), 2) |&gt; # Mark long-term red render() Try clicking on the bars in the barplot to confirm there is a fairly minimal overlap between the data points in the three categories. To remove all selection, double-click the figure. However, the pooling effect does not itself explain the absence of points between the three leaflets. If the distribution of cases and days within each of the three stay_category levels were uniform, we should expect to see more points within the gaps between the leaflets. This additionally suggests a potential selection process, where patients are less likely to be discharged at durations near the category boundaries. We can confirm this by plotting the average number of days a group of patients spent in care: # Compute the average number of days spent in treatment df$avg_days &lt;- df$days / df$cases df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; add_scatterplot(c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;avg_days&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;stay_category&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; assign_cases(which(df$stay_category == &quot;short-term&quot;), 1) |&gt; assign_cases(which(df$stay_category == &quot;long-term&quot;), 2) |&gt; set_scale(&quot;scatterplot1&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, # Log-transform the scatterplot&#39;s y-axis transformation = &quot;log10&quot;, default = TRUE) |&gt; render() Now we can clearly see the gaps between the three different distributions along the y-axis. Try querying the points near the gaps by pressing the Q key and hovering over them. You should observe that the gaps roughly span the 60-90 day and 150-210 day ranges, corresponding to 2-3 months and 5-7 months, respectively. The trend we see in the scatterplot above strong indication of a selection process is at work. Specifically, it seems that patients who stay in treatment for more than two months are likely to be transferred to medium-term care and kept around for longer, and, likewise, those who stay in treatment for more than five months are likely to be moved to long-term care. There are likely administrative of health-insurance related reasons for this trend, nevertheless, it is still an interesting pattern to take note of. 7.0.2.2 Number of cases over time A key question is how have the numbers of patients in treatment evolved over time. We can investigate this by plotting the same scatterplot as we did in the section above, as well as two barplots showing the total number of cases and the total number days in treatment, within each year. We can also include a histogram of the number of days, for a good measure: schema &lt;- df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; add_scatterplot(c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; add_histogram(c(&quot;days&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; # Again, make sure to weigh the y-axis set_parameters(&quot;histogram1&quot;, width = 20) # Set histogram binwidth to 20 days schema |&gt; render() From the barplots, we can immediately see an interesting pattern: while the numbers of cases seem to have declined over time, the number of days patients spend in care seem to seems to have stayed fairly constant. This suggest that while fewer patients are being hospitalized, they are spending longer time in care. We can indeed confirm this interactively. Try clicking on the bars corresponding to the year 2010 and 2022, in either of the two barplots (feel free to mark either of the bars by holding down the 1 or 2 keys and clicking them). It is clearly visible that, compared to 2010, in 2022 there were more patients in long term care, and the relationship between the number of cases and the number of days in care was steeper. While, on its own, the declining number of cases over time might appear as a positive development, the constant number days in treatment suggests a more worrying trend. Specifically, treatment facility placements are limited resource (Organization 2022), and the fact that days in treatment have stayed constant while cases have declined may indicate that the healthcare system is becoming burdened by long-term care patients, reducing its capacity to serve new patients. We can also scrutinize the trend more closely by zooming into the histogram: schema |&gt; assign_cases(which(df$year == 2010), 1) |&gt; assign_cases(which(df$year == 2022), 2) |&gt; zoom(&quot;histogram1&quot;, c(-100, 0, 3e03, 1e05), units = &quot;data&quot;) |&gt; render() You can also zoom into a plot interactively by clicking and dragging to select a rectangular region in the plot and pressing the Z key. You can chain multiple zooms to magnify small areas. If you want to undo zooming, press either the X key to undo the revert one level of zoom, or R to reset the figure to its default state (including zoom level). By clicking on the two bars, you should be able to see that, compared with 2010, the distribution of days spent in treatment in 2022 had a fatter tail, suggesting that patients spent longer periods of time in care. 7.0.2.3 Age and child and adolescent mental health Child and adolescent mental health is a particularly important aspect of the global mental health decline. Childhood mental health disorders are particularly concerning since they can happen during critical developmental periods, leading to life-long consequences (see e.g. Keeley 2021). Furthermore, compared to adults, children have less agency in addressing mental health challenges, relying heavily on primary caregivers and schools. Fortunately, the overall proportion of children and adolescents in the data set was fairly low, amounting to &lt;9% of all cases and &lt;6% of the total number of days spent in treatment: aggregate(cbind(cases, days) ~ care_category, sum, data = df) |&gt; lapply(function(x) { if (is.numeric(x)) return(x / sum(x)) else x }) |&gt; data.frame() ## care_category cases days ## 1 adult 0.91028915 0.94285172 ## 2 child 0.08971085 0.05714828 However, we may be interested in investigating how these patient counts have evolved over time. To do this, we can make use of the following figure: # Create a figure layout with two small plots in the left # column, and one tall plot in the right column layout &lt;- matrix(c( 1, 3, 2, 3 ), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE) df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;care_category&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; set_layout(layout) |&gt; # Set the layout render() To explore how the proportion of child and adolescent patients has evolved over time, we will need to use a slightly more complex interactive workflow than we have used so far. Try taking the following steps: Mark the cases corresponding to children and adolescents by clicking on the corresponding bar in the right barplot, while holding down the 1 key Normalize the two leftmost barplots, corresponding to the number of cases and the total number of days in treatment by year, by clicking on the plots and pressing the N key (you can reverse back to absolute counts by pressing the N key again) Zoom into the regions of the two barplots containing the green cases by clicking-and-dragging to select a rectangular region and pressing the Z key. By following these steps, you should end up with a figure similar to the one below: df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;care_category&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; assign_cases(which(df$care_category == &quot;child&quot;)) |&gt; plotscaper::normalize(&quot;barplot1&quot;) |&gt; plotscaper::normalize(&quot;barplot2&quot;) |&gt; zoom(&quot;barplot1&quot;, c(0, 0, 1, 0.15)) |&gt; zoom(&quot;barplot2&quot;, c(0, 0, 1, 0.15)) |&gt; set_layout(layout) |&gt; render() Interestingly, the two barplots show the opposite trend. While the proportion of the treatment days used by children and adolescents has declined over time, the proportion of total cases they make up has increased. The relative increase in cases appears to be driven by an overall decline in patient numbers: in absolute counts, the number of child and adolescent patients has remained fairly constant between 2010 to 2022, while the total patient count has decreased. We can also get a more granular breakdown by plotting the age category variable: df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;age_category&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;age_category&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;days&quot;)) |&gt; render() Again, if we interrogate the figure by employing interactive actions such as selection, zooming, and normalization, we can discover that one age category in which there has been steady growth in both the proportion of cases and days spend in treatment are 70-79 year olds. This aligns with the limited placement availability hypothesis: while these patients account for a relatively small fraction of the total cases, they represent a disproportionately large and increasing proportion of days in treatment. Later, we will also see evidence that many of these patients suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, which require intensive long-term care. It may be the case that, with increasing life-expectancy, the healthcare system is not able to handle the influx of older patients, limiting the availability of placements. 7.0.2.4 Prevalence of mental disorders Another important information we can glean from the data set is the prevalence of different mental disorders. The data set identifies the disorders according to ICD-10, an internationally recognized disease classification system published by the World Health organization which organizes various diseases into categories based on aetiology (World Health Organization 2024a). In the data set, the vast majority diagnoses come from the F category, which represents mental and behavioral disorders, although there are also few references to the G category, which represents diseases of the nervous system. Also note that while some levels of the diagnosis variable represent a singular ICD-10 diagnosis (e.g. f10, f2), other represent a range of diagnoses (e.g. f11-f19), a union (e.g. f0 and g30), or an exclusive difference (e.g. f4 without f42). We can explore the prevalence rates of the various diagnoses, as well as their demographic characteristics, by plotting an interactive figure. For brevity, I will describe interesting features of the data in text rather than by displaying individual figures. You are encouraged to verify these findings using the figure and the interactive techniques we have discussed so far. # Create ordering for the bars in the barplot based on frequency of cases order_df &lt;- aggregate(cases ~ diagnosis, sum, data = df) order_df &lt;- order_df[order(order_df$cases), ] df |&gt; create_schema() |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;diagnosis&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;age_category&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_barplot(c(&quot;sex&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; add_histogram(c(&quot;days&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;)) |&gt; # Sort the bars by prevalence set_scale(&quot;barplot1&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, breaks = order_df$diagnosis) |&gt; render() You can also sort the barplot bars interactively by pressing the O key while the barplot is active. From the barplot in the top left panel of the figure above, we can immediately see that the majority patient load is taken up by the top 5 disorders with &gt; 40,000 cumulative cases each. &gt; Press the Q key and hover over each of the top 5 bars to see what disorders they represent. I took the liberty of transcribing classification of the disorders from the ICD-10 website (World Health Organization 2024a). In order of prevalence, each row of Table [REFERENCE] contains the diagnostic code used in the data, along with the name/description of the diagnosis/es according to ICD-10 (I also added some notes in the parentheses): Table 7.2: The data diagnosis code and ICD-10 description Code Description f10 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol f2 Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere (includes Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Creutzfeld-Jacobs disease) f0 and g30 Dementia in Alzheimer disease (f0), Alzheimer disease (g30) f4 without f42 Organic amnesic syndrome, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances (f4) without obsessive-compulsive disorder (f42). (includes non-alcoholic Korsakoff’s syndrome) f11-f19 Mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (excluding alcohol, f10) f8–f9 Unspecified organic or symptomatic mental disorder f32–f33 Depressive episode (f32), recurrent depressive disorder (f33) f60–f61 Specific personality disorders (f60; includes e.g. paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, or anxious/avoidant personality disorders), mixed and other personality disorders (f61) f7 Personality and behavioural disorders due to brain disease, damage and dysfunction f3 without f32&amp;f33 Unspecified dementia (f3) without depression (f32 and f33) f62–f69 Personality and behavioral disorders (includes things such as PTSD, habit and impulse disorders, sexual preference disorders, etc…) f5 Delirium, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances other f42 Obsessive-compulsive disorder Thus, the five most common mental disorders, ranked in order of prevalence, were: alcohol-use related disorders, dementias (including Alzheimer’s and other forms), organic amnesic syndrome (not induced by psychoactive substances), and disorders caused by psychoactive substances (excluding alcohol). Interestingly, more frequently discussed conditions like depression and personality disorders were less prevalent. However, this may be due to the fact that less severe forms of these disorders can managed through outpatient treatment, such as a combination of medication and therapy (see e.g. Roiser, Elliott, and Sahakian 2012), with long-term psychiatric care reserved only for the most acute episodes. The high prevalence of four of the top five diagnoses is fairly intuitive. First, alcohol use disorders - the most common diagnosis - rank among the most common disorders globally and are associated with high mortality due to chronic health conditions and injury (Carvalho et al. 2019). This diagnosis was about twice as common in men and showed a fairly symmetric, normal-shaped age distribution, occuring the most frequently in 40-60 year olds. Second, the high prevalence of dementias, including Alzheimer’s disease, is unfortunately also to be expected, as these are fairly common neurodegenerative diseases in developed countries (see e.g. Cao et al. 2020; Langa et al. 2017). Particularly, Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of long-term psychiatric care in old age, as can be seen from the strongly skewed age distribution. Finally, the high prevalence of disorders due to use of psychoactive substances is also not unexpected, since, among European countries, Czechia ranks moderately high in consumption of certain substances such as ecstasy and cannabis (Mounteney et al. 2016). By contrast, these disorders were more prevalent in young people, peaking around 20-29 years of age. The high prevalence of organic amnesic syndrome is perhaps more surprising. The ICD-10 describes it as: “a syndrome of prominent impairment of recent and remote memory while immediate recall is preserved, with reduced ability to learn new material and disorientation in time” with a known physical cause and explicitly includes non-alcoholic Korsakoff’s syndrome (World Health Organization 2024a). Notably however, the classification excludes other forms of amnesia, including anterograde and retrograde, as well as cases caused by psychoactive substances. Further, the data code also explicitly excludes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This may seem strange, however, there is evidence that people with OCD tend to obsess over not remembering certain events and have less confidence in recollecting things from the past (see e.g. Muller and Roberts 2005). For instance, a person with OCD may have anxiety over whether they locked their doors or turned off the stove. Thus, individuals with OCD may over-report memory problems, and the data set’s authors likely explicitly excluded OCD for this reason. The age distribution for organic amnesia was fairly uniform, and the disorder was roughly twice as prevalent in women than in men. This actually aligns fairly well with the systematic review by Scalzo et al. (2015), who found a 1:1.84 male-to-female ratio of non-alcoholic Korsakoff’s, largely due to the second most common cause being hyperemesis gravidarum, which is a syndrome of acute nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (with the most common cause being gastrointestinal tract diseases or surgery). In general, Korsakoff’s disorder is often caused by poor nutritional intake, particularly thiamine deficiency (Chandrakumar, Bhardwaj, and Jong 2019; Sechi and Serra 2007). While I have not been able to find epidemiological studies comparing the prevalence rates of non-alcoholic Korsakoff’s syndrome across different countries, there is some evidence that general Korsakoff’s syndrome (including alcohol-related) is fairly common in Czechia (Sechi and Serra 2007). From my cursory search, Czech oficial sources often emphasize alcoholism as the leading cause of organic amnesia and Korsakoff’s syndrome (see e.g. Ministerstvo zdravotnictví 2024). However, if we look at the data, we see that non-alcohol related organic amnesia has almost two-thirds the prevalence of all alcohol-use disorders: aggregate(cases ~ diagnosis, sum, data = df) |&gt; subset(diagnosis %in% c(&quot;f10&quot;, &quot;f4 without f42&quot;)) |&gt; transform(cases = cases / sum(cases)) ## diagnosis cases ## 2 f10 0.6118044 ## 7 f4 without f42 0.3881956 References Cao, Qing, Chen-Chen Tan, Wei Xu, Hao Hu, Xi-Peng Cao, Qiang Dong, Lan Tan, and Jin-Tai Yu. 2020. “The Prevalence of Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.” Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease 73 (3): 1157–66.
