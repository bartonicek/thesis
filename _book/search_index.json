[["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction It’s written here: “In the Beginning was the Word!” Here I stick already! Who can help me? It’s absurd, […] The Spirit helps me! I have it now, intact. And firmly write: “In the Beginning was the Act!” Faust, Part I, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ([1808] 2015) Humans are intensely visual creatures. About 20-30% of our brain is involved in visual processing (Van Essen 2003; Sheth and Young 2016), providing support for a highly sophisticated and powerful visual system (see e.g. Goebel, Muckli, and Kim 2004; Knudsen 2020; for a brief review, see Ware 2019). This enables us to perform some remarkable perceptual feats. For instance, it is well-established that our brain can process certain highly salient visual stimuli in sub-20-millisecond times, outside of conscious attention (LeDoux 2000, 2003), and that we can make extremely rapid, accurate, and parallel visual judgements, through phenomena known as subitizing and pre-attentive processing (Mandler and Shebo 1982; Treisman 1985). Features such as these establish the visual system as the most potent information channel at our disposal. Crucially, while the visual cortex excels at processing data about the natural world, it is equally adept at processing abstract information. Statisticians have long capitalized on this fact. Emerging from early charts and maps, data visualization has evolved alongside mathematical statistics, providing a complementary set of tools and methods (for a review, see Friendly 2006 or Section 3.1). While mathematical statistics was primarily developed with the goal of supporting or disproving scientific hypotheses, data visualization offered an alternative approach: unsupervised exploration. Rather than providing answers to binary decisions, it demonstrated its worth in “forcing us to notice that which we would never expect to see” (Tukey et al. 1977). This invaluable role in revealing the unexpected eventually established data visualization as an indispensable part of the applied statistician’s arsenal. Now, while vision is one of the primary ways we gather information, our interaction with the natural world extends beyond sight. When trying to understand unknown objects, we do not just look; we also touch, manipulate, and probe. Consequently, within our brain, action and perception are not independent, but instead deeply interconnected, mutually reinforcing processes (see e.g. Dijkerman and De Haan 2007; Lederman and Klatzky 2009). We learn most effectively by action and observing the resulting changes; passive observation is less effective. As the saying goes, seeing is believing, but how much is that belief really worth if you can’t put your finger on it? Naturally, statisticians would eventually come to exploit this connection between perception and action as well, just as they had done with visual perception alone. In the latter half of the twentieth century, the development of computer graphics and interactive data visualization transformed the idea of “interrogating a chart” from a mere turn of phrase into tangible reality. Suddenly, it became possible to directly manipulate the visual representation of the data in real time, such that new visual insights could be obtained at the stroke of a key or click of a button. The power of interactive data visualization quickly established it as one of the most popular ways of presenting data. Today, interactive graphics make frequent appearance in online news articles, on government websites, and in commercial dashboards. Similarly, data science developer ecosystems abound with software packages and tools for creating interactive graphics. As such, given its ubiquity, it may seem as though interactive data visualization is a “solved problem”. Yet, a number of unresolved issues surrounding the use and understanding interactive figures remain. Although large organizations favor interactive data visualizations, individual analysts seldom integrate them into their workflows (see e.g. Batch and Elmqvist 2017). Moreover, despite the development of a wide array of sophisticated interactive features over the years, only a small fraction of them make it into widely available software (see Section 3). Finally, a core underlying issue is that of data pipelines: how do we go about transforming raw data into something that can be visualized interactively, in a simple yet efficient manner (Wickham et al. 2009; Vanderplas, Cook, and Hofmann 2020)? In this thesis, I explore these gaps and try to identify the underlying issues which make the development of interactive data visualization systems challenging. A recurring theme will be that, although plots are visual entities composed of geometric objects, they are not mere pictures. Instead, they contain a significant amount of implicit, algebraic structure, which becomes particularly apparent when interaction enters the scene. By focusing on the algebraic structure underlying plots, I build upon the work of Leland Wilkinson, and the Grammar of Graphics (GoG) model in particular (2012). However, I contend that, while offering a foundational framework, to fully encompass the scope of interactive graphics, the GoG model warrants certain refinements. To make the point rather bluntly, I want to draw attention to the following two quotes: “This system cannot produce a meaningless graphic, however. This is a strong claim, vulnerable to a single counter-example. It is a claim based on the formal rules of the system, however, not on the evaluation of specific graphics it may produce.” “Some of the combinations of graphs and statistical methods may be degenerate or bizarre, but there is no moral reason to restrict them.” Wilkinson (2012), pp. 15 and 112 What makes some combinations of graphics and statistics meaningful, while others degenerate or bizarre? I believe that answering this question is essential for building coherent interactive data visualization systems. Arguably, summary statistics and their properties are a somewhat overlooked part of the GoG model1; however, I contend that, when developing interactive data visualizations, grappling with them is essential. Specifically, I argue that what we can do with a graphic is fundamentally determined what the graphics is, and summary statistics are an unavoidable part of that. Certain types of plots exhibit a special kind of congruence between data, summary statistics, and visuals, which ensures predictable behavior under interaction. Other types of plots break this congruence, making implementing certain interactive features challenging. However, what is this congruence? To describe it formally, I propose a model leveraging some fundamental algebraic concepts from category theory (see e.g. Fong and Spivak 2019). These concepts, and my application of them, extends beyond the model developed by Wilkinson (2012). Specifically, unlike GoG, which treats data, statistics, and graphics as entirely independent, modular components, I propose a compositional model which focuses on preserving key mathematical properties. Finally, all of this theoretical work would be for naught if it did not lead to practical insights. Specifically, despite its theoretical underpinnings, the end-goal of this work is applied: building robust and coherent interactive data visualization systems. Thus, to validate and refine the theoretical concepts, I also develop an original open-source interactive data visualization library. Consequently, large parts of this thesis are also dedicated to the design considerations, architecture, and components of this system, along with its application to real-world data. My goal is to demonstrate that many of the theoretical considerations have direct impact on the design characteristics of the system. Ultimately, I contend that, to build truly general and efficient interactive data visualization systems, we need to take both the theoretical and practical considerations into account. 2.0.0.1 Thesis Overview The thesis is organized as follows. Section 3 provides a review of the history of interactive data visualization, theoretical considerations regarding interactivity, common interactive features, and broader data visualization theory. Section 4 identifies specific challenges in designing interactive data visualization pipelines and introduces some core algebraic theory. Section 5, outlines general objectives and goals that guided the development of the interactive data visualization software system created as part of this project. Section 6 details more specific design considerations, architectural decisions, and key components of the developed software. Section 7 presents a practical example of exploring a real-world data set using the developed system. Finally, Section 8, discusses lessons learned and potential future research directions.
