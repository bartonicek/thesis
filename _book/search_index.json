[["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction It’s written here: ‘In the Beginning was the Word!’ Here I stick already! Who can help me? It’s absurd, […] The Spirit helps me! I have it now, intact. And firmly write: ’In the Beginning was the Act! Faust, Part I, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ([1808] 2015) Humans are intensely visual creatures. About 20-30% of our brain is involved in visual processing (Van Essen 2003; Sheth and Young 2016), utilizing a highly sophisticated and powerful visual processing pipeline (see e.g. Goebel, Muckli, and Kim 2004; Knudsen 2020; for a brief review, see Ware 2019). It is well-established the brain can process certain salient visual stimuli in sub-20-millisecond times, outside of conscious attention (LeDoux 2000, 2003), and that people can make accurate, parallel, and extremely rapid visual judgements, in phenomena known as subitizing and pre-attentive processing (Mandler and Shebo 1982; Treisman 1985). These features make the visual cortex the most powerful information channel that humans possess, both in terms of bandwidth and throughput. Statisticians have known about this power of visual presentation for a long time. Starting with early charts and maps, data visualization co-evolved alongside mathematical statistics, offering an alternative and complementary perspective (for a review, see Friendly 2006 or Section 3.1). While mathematical statistics tended to focus on confirmatory hypothesis testing, data visualization provided avenues for unsupervised exploration, “forcing us to notice that which we would never expect to see” (Tukey et al. 1977). Eventually, this valuable role of forcing us to see the unexpected established data visualization as a respected tool within the applied statistician’s toolkit. Seeing an object from a distance is one thing, but being able to also touch, manipulate, and probe it is another. Within the human brain, action and perception are not independent, but are instead intricately linked, mutually reinforcing processes (see e.g. Dijkerman and De Haan 2007; Lederman and Klatzky 2009). Beginning in the 1970’s, statisticians acquired a new set of tools for exploiting this connection. The advent of computer graphics and interactive data visualization transformed the idea of “interrogating a chart” from a mere turn of phrase into tangible reality. All of a sudden, it became possible to work with the visual representation of data in a tactile way, getting new perspectives and insights at the stroke of a key or click of a button. This compelling union of the visual and the tactile has made interactive data visualization a popular method of presenting data. Nowadays, there are many packages and libraries for building interactive data visualizations across all the major data analytic languages. Interactive figures make frequent appearance in online news articles and commercial dashboards. However, despite this apparent popularity, significant gaps remain in the use and understanding of interactive visualizations. Individual analysts rarely utilize interactive data visualization tools (see e.g. Batch and Elmqvist 2017), the availability of certain more sophisticated interactive features is limited (see Section 3), and researchers still point to a lack of a general interactive data visualization pipeline (Wickham et al. 2009; Vanderplas, Cook, and Hofmann 2020). This thesis explores the challenges surrounding interactive data visualization pipelines. I argue that, contrary to some prevailing views, interactivity is not simply an add-on to static graphics. Instead, interactive visualizations must be designed with interactivity as a primary consideration. Furthermore, I contend that certain interactive features fundamentally influence the types of visualizations that can be effectively presented. My claim is that popular types of interactive visualizations exhibit a particular kind congruence between graphics, statistics, and interaction, and that the absence of this congruence results in suboptimal visualizations. I formalize this congruence using the framework of category theory. 2.0.0.1 Thesis Overview The thesis is organized as follows. Section 3 reviews the history of interactive data visualization and discusses general trends and issues in the field. In Section 4, I discuss specific problems that one faces when designing an interactive data visualization pipeline. In Section 5, I outline the specific goals and aims I had while developing the interactive data visualization library. Section 7 details the specific components and design considerations of the system. Section 8, I show an applied example of exploring a real-world data set, using my interactive data visualization library. Finally, in Section [TODO:DISCUSSION], I discuss lessons learned and potential future directions.
