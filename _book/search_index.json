[["applied-example.html", "7 Applied example", " 7 Applied example In this section, I will illustrate the use of plotscaper, showcasing the workflow and the various features of the package. The Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic (IHIS, ÚZIS in Czech) is a government agency established by the Czech Ministry of Health. Its primary roles is to collect, process, and report on medical data within the country of Czechia (ÚZIS 2024). Of interest, the institute provides high-quality, open-access medical data, including information about the use and manufacture of medicines, summaries of fiscal and employment records in medical facilities, and various epidemiological datasets. 7.0.1 The data set The data set (Soukupová et al. 2023) contains longitudinal information about psychiatric care in Czechia. More specifically, it contains aggregated data on individuals released from long-term psychiatric care facilities between 2010 and 2022. It includes information such the region of the treatment facility, the sex of the patients, age category, diagnosis based on the international ICD-10 classification (World Health Organization 2024a, 2024b), the number of hospitalizations, and the total number of days spent in care by the given subset of patients. Here’s the data set at a quick glance: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/longterm_care.csv&quot;) dplyr::glimpse(df) ## Rows: 68,115 ## Columns: 12 ## $ year &lt;int&gt; 2019, 2016, 2011, 2013, 2019, 2013, 2018, 2017, 2019, … ## $ region_code &lt;chr&gt; &quot;CZ071&quot;, &quot;CZ064&quot;, &quot;CZ080&quot;, &quot;CZ072&quot;, &quot;CZ080&quot;, &quot;CZ053&quot;, … ## $ region &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Olomoucký kraj&quot;, &quot;Jihomoravský kraj&quot;, &quot;Moravskoslezsk… ## $ sex &lt;chr&gt; &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, … ## $ diagnosis &lt;chr&gt; &quot;f10&quot;, &quot;f2&quot;, &quot;f7&quot;, &quot;f4 without f42&quot;, &quot;f60–f61&quot;, &quot;f32–f… ## $ reason_for_termination &lt;chr&gt; &quot;release&quot;, &quot;early termination&quot;, &quot;early termination&quot;, &quot;… ## $ age_category &lt;chr&gt; &quot;40–49&quot;, &quot;30–39&quot;, &quot;30–39&quot;, &quot;40–49&quot;, &quot;50–59&quot;, &quot;40–49&quot;, … ## $ stay_category &lt;chr&gt; &quot;short-term&quot;, &quot;medium-term&quot;, &quot;short-term&quot;, &quot;short-term… ## $ field &lt;chr&gt; &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;psychiatry&quot;… ## $ care_category &lt;chr&gt; &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, … ## $ hospitalizations &lt;int&gt; 13, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 32, 2, 2, 1, 12, 1, 1, 2, 9, 18,… ## $ days &lt;int&gt; 196, 345, 38, 108, 1, 47, 319, 3813, 120, 256, 151, 57… The data set contains over 68,000 rows, totalling over 410,000 hospitalizations. Each row records the number patients with a particular set of of characteristics released from a treatment facility during a given year, and the number of days the patients spent in treatment in total. The original dataset used Czech column names and category labels. To make the analysis more easily accessible to non-Czech speakers, I took the liberty of translating most of these to English (excluding the region variable). The translation script is available in the thesis repository, at the following path: ./data/longterm_care_translate.R. Additionally, the data set website contains a JSON schema with a text description of each of the variables (Soukupová et al. 2023). I took the liberty of translating these descriptions as well, and provide them below, in table Table 7.1: Table 7.1: Schema of the long-term care data set, including the original column names (Czech), as well as translated names and descriptions. Translated name Original name Description year rok The year hospitalization was terminated region_code kraj_kod Region code based on the NUTS 3 classification region kraj_nazev Region where the facility was located sex pohlavi Classification of patients’ sex diagnosis zakladni_diagnoza The primary diagnosis of the psychiatric disorder based on the ICD-10 classification reason_for_termination ukonceni The reason for termination of care age_category vekova_kategorie Classification of patients’ age category field obor The field of psychiatric care care_category kategorie_pece Classification of care: child or adult hospitalizations pocet_hospitalizaci The total number of hospitalizations in a given subgroup of patients days delka_hospitlizace The total time spent in care, in days. Specifically, the total number of days all patients in a given subgroup spent in care. 7.0.2 Initial exploration References Soukupová, J, H Melicharová, O Šanca, V Bartůněk, J Jarkovský, and M Komenda. 2023. “Dlouhodobá psychiatrická péče.” NZIP. https://www.nzip.cz/data/2060-dlouhodoba-psychiatricka-pece.
