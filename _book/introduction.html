<p>What is an interactive data visualization? Surprisingly, despite the widespread popularity of interactive visualizations, if you ask data visualization researchers, you may get many different and even incompatible answers. This lack of a clear consensus makes it challenging to discuss existing work without some clarification. Let’s first survey the available literature and then try to define what the “interactive” and “interactivity” mean within the scope of the present thesis.</p>
<div id="interactive-visualization-vs.-interacting-with-a-visualization" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Interactive Visualization vs. Interacting with a Visualization<a href="introduction.html#interactive-visualization-vs.-interacting-with-a-visualization" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>First, when we say “interactive data visualization”, are we using the term as a noun, referring to a concrete figure or chart, or are we using the term as a verb, referring to the practice of visualization? This “overloading” of the term, as described by <span class="citation">Pike et al. (<a href="#ref-pike2009">2009</a>)</span>, creates confusion in the field, reflected in the available literature <span class="citation">(see also <a href="#ref-yi2007">Yi et al. 2007a</a>)</span>. One can find papers which discuss concrete implementations of data visualization systems and the relevant mathematical theory, with little to no mention of the underlying psychology of the user. Equally likely, one can find papers which delve deep into the cognitive and human-computer interaction aspects of visualization, without referring to any concrete implementations. This points to an important fact about interactive data visualization: rather than being a singular field, it is in fact an intersection of several different fields, including statistics, computer science, cognitive psychology, and human-computer interaction. The interdisciplinary nature of the topic highlights the need to use clear and specific definitions.</p>
<p>While I do plan to discuss some fundamental aspects of the psychology of interacting with visualizations, when used in this thesis, the term <em>“interactive data visualization”</em> will refer to concrete charts or figures, typically displayed on a computer screen. When referring to the practice of interactive data visualization, I will try to use more active terms such as <em>“interacting with a visualization”</em>, to indicate that the term is meant to be interpreted as a verb and not a noun.</p>
</div>
<div id="features-of-interactivity" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Features of Interactivity<a href="introduction.html#features-of-interactivity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>But even when we focus on interactive data visualizations as charts or figures, there are still considerable differences in what different researchers consider the bar for “interactivity”. To some, almost any user manipulation qualifies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brodbeck2009">Brodbeck, Mazza, and Lalanne 2009</a>)</span>. Others emphasise the speed of response, with faster updates translating to greater interactivity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-becker1987">Becker and Cleveland 1987</a>; <a href="#ref-buja1996">Buja, Cook, and Swayne 1996</a>)</span>. Complicating matters further, some researchers make the distinction between “interactive” and “dynamic” manipulation. According to these researchers, interactive manipulation involves discrete actions such as pressing a button or selecting an item from a drop-down menu, whereas dynamic manipulation involves continuous actions, like moving a slider or clicking-and-dragging to highlight a rectangular area <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rheingans2002">Rheingans 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-jankun2007">Jankun-Kelly, Ma, and Gertz 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Yet, for other researchers, the two definitions outlined above (the user can do something and changes propagate fast enough) are far too broad. For many, true interactivity hinges on high-level features, such as the ability to query different parts of the dataset (by e.g. zooming, panning, and filtering), and reactive propagation of changes between connected or “linked” parts of a figure <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kehrer2012">Kehrer et al. 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-buja1996">Buja, Cook, and Swayne 1996</a>; <a href="#ref-keim2002">Keim 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-unwin1999">Unwin 1999</a>)</span>. Similarly, in Visual Analytics (VA) research, a distinction is made between “surface-level” (or “low-level”) and “parametric” (or “high-level”) interactions, where surface-level interactions manipulate attributes of the visual domain only (e.g. zooming and panning), whereas parametric interactions manipulate attributes of mathematical models or algorithms underlying the visualization <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-leman2013">Leman et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-pike2009">Pike et al. 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In Table <a href="introduction.html#tab:definitions">2.1</a>, I have summarized the several important definitions of interactivity, as discussed above. This list is in no way supposed to be exhaustive <span class="citation">(more complete taxonomies of interactive visualizations have been described before, see <a href="#ref-yi2007toward">Yi et al. 2007b</a>)</span>. Instead, it serves as a jumping off point for further discussion.</p>

<p>The different definitions of interactivity imply radically different implementation requirements. For example, under the broad “user interaction” definition, it could be argued that even running code from the command line could be considered “interactive visualization”. Further, these interactions may be purely visual and require little to no data wrangling: for example, changing color or size of points in a scatterplot can be done without reference to the original data. In contrast, features such as filtering, linking, or parametric interaction, cannot be implemented without specialized data structures that handle updates. These interactions extend beyond the purely visual realm and require the system to be able to refer back to the original data in order to recompute new summaries.</p>

<p>I argue that applications of category theory to visualization can be classified in one of two ways: in a more “abstract” way, with authors trying to lay down theoretical foundations for what it means to “visualize” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-beckmann1995">Beckmann 1995</a>)</span> or which visualizations can be considered well-formed perceptual representations of the data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kindlmann2014">Kindlmann and Scheidegger 2014</a>)</span>, and a more “applied” way, with authors introducing libraries and domain-specific languages which allow for constructing plots and figures in a compositional, functional-programming style <span class="citation">(see e.g. <a href="#ref-yorgey2012">Yorgey 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-petricek2021">Petricek 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-smeltzer2014">Smeltzer, Erwig, and Metoyer 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-smeltzer2018">Smeltzer and Erwig 2018</a>)</span>. The present thesis attempts to do neither. Instead, the goal is to focus on a much more narrow area of data visualization: the computation of statistics on data.</p>
<p>Category theory is an area of mathematics concerned with the ideas of structure, relation, and composition. It may seem at first that such an abstract area of mathematics would be far removed from the applied field of interactive data visualization. However, this thesis is aims to demonstrate that category theory is in fact deeply relevant to the production of meaningful interactive graphics.</p>
<p>Moreover, the idea of using category theory in an applied discipline such as graphics is not unprecedented. In recent decades, category theory has been making inroads into other applied disciplines, including computer science, physics, biology, and epidemiology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baez2023">Baez 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-fong2019">Fong and Spivak 2019</a>)</span>, under the guise of “applied category theory”.</p>
<p>The following chapter gives an overview of some concepts from applied category theory which may be relevant to the production of interactive graphics. It follows mainly from <span class="citation">Fong and Spivak (<a href="#ref-fong2019">2019</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Lawvere and Schanuel (<a href="#ref-lawvere2009">2009</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Baez (<a href="#ref-baez2023">2023</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Milewski (<a href="#ref-milewski2018">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="relations" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Relations<a href="introduction.html#relations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Relations are some of the simplest mathematical structures. Given two sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, a relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a subset of the Cartesian product of the two sets, <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq X \times Y\)</span>. In other words, a relation can be thought of as the set of <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> pairs <span class="math inline">\(\in X \times Y\)</span> for which the condition that “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> relate” is true. Note that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can also be the same set, such that <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq X \times X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since a relation is a subset of the product set <span class="math inline">\(X \times Y\)</span>, we can display it as a matrix with values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as rows and values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as columns and the pairs <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> which relate marked in some specific way. For example, here’s how we can display the usual order relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> on the set <span class="math inline">\(X = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:relations-subset"></span>

From the diagram, we see that 1 is less than or equal to every element of y, 2 is less than or equal to 2 and 3, and 3 is less than or equal to 3 only. Note the symmetry between rows and columns - this is due to the fact that we have the same set ($X$) on both dimensions. " width="2100" />

Figure 2.1: Relations as a subset of the Cartesian product on two sets. From the diagram, we see that 1 is less than or equal to every element of y, 2 is less than or equal to 2 and 3, and 3 is less than or equal to 3 only. Note the symmetry between rows and columns - this is due to the fact that we have the same set (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) on both dimensions.
</p>
</div>
<p>Under some relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, if two elements <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in X\)</span> relate, i.e. if <span class="math inline">\((x, y) \in R\)</span>, we can write this using the infix notation using some infix symbol such as <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span>: then, if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> relate, we write <span class="math inline">\(x \star_R y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x \star y\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> implicit). For example, for common relations such as <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>, we write <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is also sometimes used, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(x R y\)</span>. If the elements do not relate, i.e. <span class="math inline">\((x, y) \not \in R\)</span>, we typically do not write this out explicitly.</p>
<p>Relations can have properties. For example, many types of relations are <em>reflexive</em>, meaning that <span class="math inline">\(x \star x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> (every element relates to itself). Of note, specifying three specific properties allow us to define equivalence relations:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-1" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.1  (Equivalence relation) </strong></span>A relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is called an equivalence relation if it is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Reflexive</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \sim x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span></li>
<li><em>Symmetric</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \sim y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(y \sim x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in X\)</span></li>
<li><em>Transitive</em>: if <span class="math inline">\(x \sim y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \sim z\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x \sim z\)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Equivalence relations encode the notion that two things are <em>same-ish</em>. We can further use them to assign objects in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <em>equivalence classes</em>, which group equivalent objects together. That is, for some element <span class="math inline">\(a \in X\)</span>, its corresponding equivalence class is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[[a] = \{ x \in X : x \sim a \}\]</span>
We can do a lot of things with relations. The next few sections will discuss three important examples: functions, partitions, and preorders.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Functions<a href="introduction.html#functions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A function is a special kind of relation that encodes a mapping between two sets. More specifically, let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the set of sources (also called the <em>domain</em>) and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be the set of possible targets (also called the <em>codomain</em>). Then, we can think of a function as a relation <span class="math inline">\(F \subseteq S \times T\)</span> of valid source-target pairs <span class="math inline">\((s, t)\)</span>, such that for every <span class="math inline">\(s \in S\)</span> in there exists a unique <span class="math inline">\(t \in T\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\((s, t) \in F\)</span> (see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:function-subset">2.2</a>). In other words, every source relates to exactly one target, see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:function-subset">2.2</a>:</p>

<p>We can classify functions based on how their domains and codomains map onto each other (see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:function-types">2.3</a>).

<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-2" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.2  (Surjectivity) </strong></span>A function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is surjective if, for all <span class="math inline">\(t \in T\)</span>, there exists a <span class="math inline">\(s \in S\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(s) = t\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, if each source in the function’s domain leads to a unique target, then we call such a function <em>injective</em> or <em>one-to-one</em>. That is:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-3" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.3  (Injectivity) </strong></span>A function is injective if for all <span class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2 \in S\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(f(s_1) = t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(s_2) = t\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(s_1 = s_2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, if a function is both surjective and injective, meaning that every target can be reached from, and only from, a unique source, then we call such a function <em>bijective</em> or a <em>bijection</em>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-4" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.4  (Bijectivity) </strong></span>A function is a bijection and only if it is both surjective and injective, and if and only if it is invertible.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Bijections are special since they encode the idea of <em>reversibility</em> or <em>lossless transformation</em>. Any bijective function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has an associated inverse function <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(f^{-1}(a)) = a\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in the function’s domain and codomain, respectively, and we can keep switching back and forth from domain to codomain and back without losing any information. We’ll generalize this idea later when we discuss <em>isomorphisms</em>.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose I have a group of friends <span class="math inline">\(f \in F\)</span> that each went to one city <span class="math inline">\(c \in C\)</span> in Europe during the holiday. I can construct a function <span class="math inline">\(f: F \to C\)</span> that sends each friend to his or her holiday destination. If every city in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> was visited by at least one friend, then the function is surjective. If each friend went to a different destination, then the function is injective. If both are true - that is, if every city on our list was visited by exactly one friend - then the function is bijective. In that case, we could just as well use the names of cities <span class="math inline">\(c \in C\)</span> when we speak of friends <span class="math inline">\(f \in F\)</span> - instead of “Sam”, we could say “the person who went to Rome”, and it would be clear who are we talking about.</p>
<p>An important property of functions is that they can be composed. Specifically, if the domain of one function matches the codomain of another, the functions can be composed by piping the output of one into another to form a new function:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-5" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.5  (Function composition) </strong></span>If we have two functions <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g: Y \to Z\)</span>, we can form a new function <span class="math inline">\(h: X \to Z\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[h(x) = g(f(x))\]</span>
We can omit the explicit reference to the variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and write the composition in several different ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(h = g \circ f\)</span> (read: “apply <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> after <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>”)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h = gf\)</span> (same as above)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h = f ⨾ g\)</span> (read “apply <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>”)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>I will use the bracket notation (<span class="math inline">\(h(x) = g(f(x))\)</span>) when explicitly referring to the variable, and the postfix/fat semicolon notation (<span class="math inline">\(h = f ⨾ g\)</span>) otherwise.</p>
<p>There are other things we can do with functions. For example, given a subset of sources, we can ask about the <em>image</em> - the set of targets we can reach from those sources:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-6" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.6  (Image) </strong></span>For some subset <span class="math inline">\(S_i \subseteq S\)</span>, its image under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(f_!(S_i) = \{ f(s) \in T \lvert s \in S_i \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Likewise, given a subset of targets, we can ask about the <em>pre-image</em> - the set of sources that could have produced those targets. That is:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-7" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.7  (Pre-image) </strong></span>For some subset <span class="math inline">\(T_i \subseteq T\)</span>, its pre-image under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(f^*(T_i) = \{ s \in S \lvert f(s) \in T_i \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>An important fact to note is that, although the pre-image <span class="math inline">\(f^*\)</span> is also sometimes called “inverse image”, it is <em>not</em> the inverse of the image <span class="math inline">\(f_!\)</span> for most functions (unless they are bijections). That is, by applying the pre-image after image or vice versa, we cannot expect to come up with the same set as we started with. Specifically, if we have a non-injective function and apply the pre-image after the image, we may come up with <em>more</em> sources that we started with, <span class="math inline">\(S_i \subseteq f^*(f_!(S_i))\)</span> (equality if injective), and similarly, if we have a non-surjective function and apply the image after the pre-image, we might end up with <em>fewer</em> targets than we started with, <span class="math inline">\(f_!(f^*(T_i)) \subseteq T_i\)</span> (again, equality if surjective).</p>
<p>As an example, suppose again I have the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> which maps each friend to a holiday destination. The image of that function, <span class="math inline">\(f_!\)</span>, maps a set of friends to the set of all cities that at least one of them went to, and similarly, the pre-image, <span class="math inline">\(f^*\)</span>, maps a set of cities to the set of friends that went to them.<br />
Now, suppose that Sam and Dominic went to Rome, and I ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“who went to [the city that Sam went to]?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will get both Sam and Dominic back, since:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f^*(f_!(\{ Sam \})) = f^*(\{ Rome \}) = \{ Sam, Dominic \}\]</span></p>
<p>That is, I will get back Sam and Dominic <em>even though I had initially only asked about Sam</em>. Similarly, if no friends had visited Paris and I ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“what are the cities that [people who went to Paris or Rome] went to?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>then I will get Rome only, since</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_!(f^*(\{Paris, Rome \})) = f_!(\{ Sam, Dominic \}) = \{ Rome \}\]</span></p>
<p>This weird relationship between the the image and the pre-image is due to the fact that the image is actually something called <em>left adjoint</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baez2023">Baez 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-fong2019">Fong and Spivak 2019</a>)</span>. Adjoints can be thought of as the “best approximate answer to a problem that has no solution” <span class="citation">(no inverse, <a href="#ref-baez2023">Baez 2023</a>)</span>, and they come in pairs - a left and a right adjoint - with the left adjoint being more permissive or “liberal” and the right adjoint being more strict or “conservative” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baez2023">Baez 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Proper treatment of adjoint is beyond the scope of this thesis, however.</p>

<div id="partitions" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Partitions<a href="introduction.html#partitions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>One useful thing we can construct with functions (or equivalently, relations) are partitions. Partitions encode the idea of splitting elements of some some into distinct groups.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-8" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.8  (Function definition of a partition) </strong></span>Given some set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, a set of part labels <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and a surjective function <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to P\)</span>, we can partition <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by assigning every element <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> a part label <span class="math inline">\(p \in P\)</span>, by simply applying the function: <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = p\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Above we used a function to define a partition, however, we can achieve the same with a relations, specifically equivalence classes. By taking any part label <span class="math inline">\(p \in P\)</span>, we can recover the corresponding subset of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by pulling out its pre-image: <span class="math inline">\(f^*(\{p\}) = X_p \subseteq X\)</span>. We can then define a partition without reference to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-9" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.9  (Equivalence class definition of a partition) </strong></span>A partition of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> consists of a set of part labels <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, such that, for all <span class="math inline">\(p \in P\)</span>, there is a non-empty subset <span class="math inline">\(A_p \subseteq A\)</span> which forms an equivalence class on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X = \bigcup_{p \in P} X_p \qquad \text{and} \qquad \text{if } p \neq q, \text{ then } X_p \cap X_q = \varnothing\]</span>
I.e. the parts <span class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span> jointly cover the entirety of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and parts cannot share any elements.</p>
</div>
<p>We can rank partitions by their coarseness. That is, for any set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the coarsest partition is one with only one part label <span class="math inline">\(P = \{ 1 \}\)</span>, such that each element of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> gets assigned <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> as label. Conversely, the finest partition is one where each element gets assigned its own unique part label, such that <span class="math inline">\(\lvert X \lvert = \lvert P \lvert\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given two partitions, we can form a finer (or at least as fine) partition by taking their intersection, i.e. by taking the set of all unique pairs of labels that co-occur for any <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> as the new part labels. For example, suppose <span class="math inline">\(X = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}\)</span> and partition 1 assigns part labels:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_1(x) = \begin{cases}
a &amp; \text{if } x = 1 \text{ or } x = 2 \\
b &amp; \text{if } x = 3
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>and partition 2 assigns part labels the following way:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p_2(a) = \begin{cases}
s &amp; \text{if } x = 1 \\
t &amp; \text{if } x = 2 \text{ or } x = 3
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>Then the intersection partition will have the following part labels <span class="math inline">\(P_3 = \{ (a, s), (a, t), (b, t) \}\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p_3(a) = \begin{cases}
(a, s) &amp; \text{if } x = 1 \\
(b, s) &amp; \text{if } x = 2 \\
(b, t) &amp; \text{if } x = 3
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>

<div id="preorders" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Preorders<a href="introduction.html#preorders" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-10" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.10  (Preorder) </strong></span>A preorder is a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> equipped with a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> that conforms to two simple properties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Reflexivity</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \leq x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span></li>
<li><em>Transitivity</em>: if <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \leq z\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x \leq z\)</span>, for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z \in X\)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Simply speaking, this means that between any two elements in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, there either is a relation and the elements relate (one element is somehow “less than or equal” to the other), or the two elements do not relate.</p>
<p>An example of a preorder is the family tree, with the underlying set being the set of family members: <span class="math inline">\(X = \{ \textbf{daughter}, \textbf{son}, \textbf{mother}, \textbf{father}, \textbf{grandmother}, ... \}\)</span> and the binary relation being ancestry or familial relation. Thus, for example, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{daughter} \leq \textbf{father}\)</span>, since the daughter is related to the father, and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{father} \leq \textbf{father}\)</span>, since a person is related to themselves. However, there is no relation (<span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>) between <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{father}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{mother}\)</span> since they are not related. Finally, since <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{daughter} \leq \textbf{father}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{father} \leq \textbf{grandmother}\)</span>, then, by reflexivity, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{daughter} \leq \textbf{grandmother}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can further restrict preorders by imposing additional properties, such as:</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \leq x\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> (anti-symmetry)</li>
<li>Either <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \leq x\)</span> (comparability)</li>
</ol>
<p>If a preorder conforms to 3., we speak of a partially ordered set or <em>poset</em>. If it conforms to both 3. and 4., then it is a <em>total order</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="monoids" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Monoids<a href="introduction.html#monoids" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A monoid is a tuple <span class="math inline">\((M, e, \otimes)\)</span> consisting of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>A set of objects <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></li>
<li>A neutral element <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> called the <em>monoidal unit</em></li>
<li>A binary function <span class="math inline">\(\otimes: M \times M \to M\)</span> called the <em>monoidal product</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Such that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(m \otimes e = e \otimes m = m\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m \in M\)</span> (unitality)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(m_1 \otimes (m_2 \otimes m_3) = (m_1 \otimes m_2) \otimes m_3 = m_1 \otimes m_2 \otimes m_3\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m_1, m_2, m_3 \in M\)</span> (associativity)</li>
</ol>
<p>In simple terms, monoids encapsulate the idea that <em>the whole is exactly the “sum” of its parts</em> (where “sum” can be replaced by the monoidal product). Specifically, we have some elements and a way to combine them, and when we combine the same elements, no matter where we put the brackets we always get the same result (i.e. something like “the order does not matter”, although that is not precisely right, more on that later). Finally, we have some neutral element that when combined with an element yields back the same element.</p>
<p>For example, take summation on natural numbers, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{N}, 0, +)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \qquad \text{(unitality)}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[1 + (2 + 3) = (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + 2 + 3 \qquad \text{(associativity)}\]</span></p>
<p>Likewise, products of real numbers <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, 1, \times)\)</span> are also a monoid, and so is multiplication of <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> square matrices <span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{M}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}, \mathbf{I}, \cdot)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{I}\)</span> is the identity matrix and <span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> stands for an infix operator that is usually omitted. As a counterexample, exponentiation does not meet the definition of a monoid, since it is not associative: <span class="math inline">\(x^{(y^z)} \neq (x^y)^z\)</span>.</p>
<p>We may want to impose further restrictions on monoids, for example:</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(m_1 \otimes m_2 = m_2 \otimes m_1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m_1, m_2 \in M\)</span> (commutativity)</li>
</ol>
<p>Both commutativity and associativity can both be viewed as a kind of “order does not matter” rule, however, they are fundamentally different. Let’s imagine our set of objects consists of three wires of different colours <span class="math inline">\(\{ \textbf{red}, \textbf{green}, \textbf{blue} \}\)</span> and the monoidal product consists of connecting wires. Let’s also imagine that the <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{red}\)</span> wire is connected to a power source and the <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{blue}\)</span> wire is connected to a lightbulb, and the blue wire amplifies the current from the power source such that it is enough to power the light bulb. To turn on the lightbulb, we need to connect <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{red} \to \textbf{green}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{green} \to \textbf{blue}\)</span>. The time order in which we connect the three wires does not matter: we can connect <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{green} \to \textbf{blue}\)</span> first and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{red} \to \textbf{green}\)</span> second or vice versa, either way we get the same result (lightbulb turns on). However, the spatial order in which we connect the wires <em>does</em> matter: if we connect <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{red} \to \textbf{blue}\)</span>, then the current will not be enough to power the lightbulb. Hence, the operation is associative (temporal order does not matter) but not commutative (spatial order does matter).</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a preorder, another restriction we may want to impose is that the monoidal product is strictly increasing:</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(m_1 \leq m_1 \otimes m_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_2 \leq m_1 \otimes m_2\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m_1, m_2 \in M\)</span> (monotonicity)</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that when we combine two things, we get back something that’s at least as big as the bigger of the two things. Summation of natural numbers <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{N}, 0, +)\)</span> again works, but for example summation of integers <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}, 0, +)\)</span> or multiplication of reals <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, 1, \times)\)</span> does not.</p>

<p>Every data visualization system needs some way of translating abstract data values into concrete graphical attributes such as position, size, or colour. Given the ubiquitous need for scales, one might expect them to be a “solved issue”, within the relevant literature. However, this is far from the truth. Specifically, the issues of scales and measurement present are still being grappled with the areas of mathematics and philosophy of science to this day <span class="citation">(for a gentle yet thorough introduction, see <a href="#ref-tal2015">Tal 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Scales are another area of data visualization in which there has been considerable debate, with many terms being overloaded and relating to concepts from different fields. This is due to the fact that the issue of how to compare, rank, and translate values has a long and complicated history. In particular, the issue of measurement has been hotly debated in the field of psychometrics and mathematical psychology, leading to the development of the <em>theory of measurement</em> (which has some overlap with, but is not the same as, <em>measurement theory</em> in mathematics).</p>
<p>One paper that has been key to the debate around scales and measurement has been the seminal work of <span class="citation">Stevens (<a href="#ref-stevens1946">1946</a>)</span>. In this paper, Stevens defined a <em>scale</em> as a method of assigning numbers to values, allowing for various kinds of comparisons. Further, by considering transformations which preserve the comparisons, Stevens identified 4 types of scales: <em>nominal</em>, <em>ordinal</em>, <em>interval</em>, and <em>ratio</em> <span class="citation">(see also <a href="#ref-michell1986">Michell 1986</a>; <a href="#ref-velleman1993">Velleman and Wilkinson 1993</a>)</span>.</p>

<p><em>Nominal</em> scales correspond to equivalence relations. An equivalence relation is a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> on some set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which, for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z \in X\)</span>, has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reflexivity</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \sim x\)</span></li>
<li><em>Symmetry</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \sim y \text{ if and only if } y \sim x\)</span></li>
<li><em>Transitivity</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \sim y \text{ and } y \sim z \text{ then } x \sim z\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Intuitively, we can think of the numbers on a nominal scale as “labels”, and the only question which we can ask a nominal scale is whether two labels are the same or different. A such, examples of variables with nominal scale include variables of which we typically think of as categorical, such as color, species, or political party. It does not make sense to say “blue is <em>more</em> than green” or “cat is <em>more</em> than dog” without specifying some other axis along which we compare. It does make sense, however, to say “Daisy and Molly are the same species of animal (cat)” or “these two glasses are of different colors”.</p>
<p>The only transformations which are permissible for nominal scales are permutations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stevens1946">Stevens 1946</a>)</span>. For example, if we use the numbers <span class="math inline">\(\{ 1, 2, 3 \}\)</span> to represent the species <span class="math inline">\(S = \{ \text{cat}, \text{dog}, \text{hamster} \}\)</span>, respectively, we can assign the numbers in any order we want and the properties of the scale are preserved.</p>
<p>It is arguable whether any nominal quantities exist in and of themselves or whether they only ever exists as abstract social constructions over underlying continuous reality. Color is a discretization of the visible light spectrum (frequency of electromagnetic radiation), and the pre-Darwinian concept of a species is likewise an abstraction over continuously varying distribution of genes <span class="citation">(although there have been some attempts to ground the definition of a discrete species in the theory of genetics, e.g. as a population of individuals which can produce viable offsprings, see <a href="#ref-mayr1999">Mayr 1999</a>)</span>. Further, even many subjective concepts which are typically described as discrete such as emotions may be abstractions over underlying continuous phenomena <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barrett2013">Barrett 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, even if nominal quantities are entirely socially constructed, this does not mean they are arbitrary or useless. SEARLE</p>

<div id="ordinal-scales" class="section level5 hasAnchor" number="2.3.1.0.2">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.0.2</span> Ordinal scales<a href="introduction.html#ordinal-scales" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p><em>Ordinal</em> scales correspond to total orders. A total order is a relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which, for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z \in X\)</span>, has the following properties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Reflexivity</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \leq x\)</span></li>
<li><em>Antisymmetry</em>: <span class="math inline">\(\text{if } x \leq y \leq x \text{ then } x = y\)</span></li>
<li><em>Transitivity</em>: <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y \text{ and } y \leq z \text{ then } x \leq z\)</span></li>
<li><em>Totality</em> or <em>comparability</em> or <em>strong connectedness</em>: <span class="math inline">\(\text{for all } x, y, \text{ either } x \leq y \text{ or } y \leq x\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of total orders include the usual ordering <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> on natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq 2 \leq 3 \leq \ldots\)</span> or the alphabetical order on letters: <span class="math inline">\(A \leq B \leq C \ldots \leq Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>As total orders, ordinal scales allow us to rank quantities. A good example of an ordinal variable is placement in a race or competition. If Emma and Charlotte ran a marathon, and Emma placed 2nd and Charlotte 3rd, we can say that Charlotte ran finished the race earlier than Emma. However, we do not know whether she crossed the finish line 15 minutes or 2 hours earlier, or whether or not her average pace was less than half of that of Emma.</p>
<p>Some authors have related ordinal scales to <em>weak orders</em> <span class="citation">(see <a href="#ref-michell1986">Michell 1986</a>)</span>. Weak orders <span class="citation">(also known as <em>total preorders</em>, see <a href="#ref-nlab2024d">nLab 2024a</a>)</span> generalize total orders by allowing for ties (properties 2. and 4. above do not need hold). While this could seem desirable, I opted to relate ordinal scales to total orders here instead, since there is currently some ambiguity in the literature in the way the term <em>weak order</em> is being used <span class="citation">(see e.g. <a href="#ref-nlab2024a">nLab 2024b</a>, <a href="#ref-nlab2024b">2024c</a>; <a href="#ref-stackexchange2024">Abrams 2024</a>)</span>, and, for practical data analysis, the distinction is fairly inconsequential. For instance, in the marathon example above, if Emma and Charlotte both placed second, after Lucy and before Lily, we could frame the outcome of the race as the following weak order on the set <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> of marathoners: <span class="math inline">\(\text{Lucy} \leq \text{Emma, Charlotte} \leq \text{Lily} \leq ...\)</span>. However, the underlying set of ranks <span class="math inline">\(R \subset \mathbb{N}\)</span> still retains a total ordering: <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq 2 \leq 3 \leq \ldots\)</span> and we can specify a surjective monotonically increasing function <span class="math inline">\(r: M \to R\)</span> which maps each marathoner to her rank. Clearly, we can map any weak order to a total order by applying a functor which enforces anti-symmetry in this way <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fong2019">Fong and Spivak 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-nlab2024d">nLab 2024a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The only transformations which are permissible for ordinal scales are those which preserve order, that is, monotonic increasing transformations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stevens1946">Stevens 1946</a>; <a href="#ref-michell1986">Michell 1986</a>)</span>. For example, transforming our set of ranks <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> by taking the log or square root of each rank leaves the order relations between them unchanged.</p>

<div id="interval-scales" class="section level5 hasAnchor" number="2.3.1.0.3">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.0.3</span> Interval scales<a href="introduction.html#interval-scales" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p><em>Interval</em> scales.</p>
<p>Interval scales allow us to identify a distance between two points. However, they do not have a natural “zero point” or intercept. As such we cannot use them to determine the ratio between two quantities. Examples of interval scales include the calendar date and geographical position. It does not make sense to say that the year 1000 CE is “twice” that of 500 CE, since the birth of Jesus Christ is (one’s personal religious beliefs aside) an arbitrary zero point: we could set the point 0 CE to any other event, such as the founding of Athens or the release of Taylor Swift’s first album, and the ratios would be altered. Likewise, it does not make sense to say that 90° longitude is “three times” that of 30° longitude: the location of the prime meridian is also the product of arbitrary historical cirumstances.</p>

<p>Unlike interval scales, ratio scale have a well-defined natural zero point. For example,</p>

<p>In the original paper, Stevens had also made the claim that the type of scale determined which statistical tests and summaries were “permissible” for the data. For example, according to Stevens, while mean is an appropriate summary of an interval scale (since expectation is linear), it would not be a permissible summary of ordinal data. This claim was later disputed by researchers</p>
